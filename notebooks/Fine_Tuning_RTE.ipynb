Steinbeck's epic novel, which traces harrowing exodus of Tom Joad and his family from blighted Oklahoma (where they are evicted from their farm), across the rugged American south-west via Highway 66, and on to what they mistakenly hope will be a more promising future in California, is considered by many readers to be the quintessential Depression-era story, and an ironic reversal of the rags-to-riches tale favoured by many optimistic Americans.\", \"When a mosquito drinks the blood an infected person, the insect also swallows the malaria parasite, which then must incubate and multiply before migrating into the insect's saliva. The process can take weeks. And because mosquitoes are small-bodied and cold-blooded, outside temperatures make a big difference in how long it takes before they can transmit the disease. If it happens too slowly, the insects die before they can infect anyone. In general, the malaria parasite does better at warmer temperatures, which is why the disease occurs most often in tropical environments. But with mathematical models, Thomas has found that, even when conditions are warm, highly fluctuating temperatures over the course of a day slow down the rate of parasite incubation and larval development in the mosquito.\", 'At home in New Hampshire, V.
